# Node.js-Additional-Notes-Exercises


Firstly, what is Node.js? As developers, we often categorize code into front-end (inside the browser) and back-end or server-side code (running on a server). Traditionally, JavaScript was confined to the front end for adding interactivity to web pages. However, Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server side or even directly on computers. While JavaScript in the browser relies on the V8 engine, Node.js is a program, also written in C++, that wraps the V8 engine. This allows us to run JavaScript on computers or servers, not just within browsers.

Understanding how computers interpret code is crucial. Computers fundamentally understand machine code, but programming languages like JavaScript are abstractions that make coding more readable. Node.js takes JavaScript and compiles it into machine code, enabling us to run JavaScript directly on computers or servers. Node.js is not just a wrapper for the V8 engine; it extends JavaScript's functionality, allowing tasks like file I/O, database connections, and server-side functionalities.


In these exercises, I'll explore various aspects of Node.js, from basic operations to advanced topics like creating an Express app, working with databases like MongoDB, and building a complete Node-powered website project.
