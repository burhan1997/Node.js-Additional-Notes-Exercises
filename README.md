# Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript not only within browsers but also on servers and computers. It wraps the V8 engine, allowing JavaScript to run directly on computers by compiling it into machine code. This breaks the traditional confinement of JavaScript to browsers.

## Understanding Computer Code:

- Computers primarily understand machine code, but languages like C++ and JavaScript provide abstractions.
- JavaScript, designed for browser interactivity, relies on the V8 engine in browsers to compile and execute code.
- Node.js, written in C++, extends this capability to servers, allowing JavaScript execution beyond the browser environment.

## Node.js Functionality:

- Beyond being a V8 engine wrapper, Node enhances JavaScript functionality for server-side tasks.
- Features include file manipulation, database connectivity, and serving content as a server.
- JavaScript, originally designed for browser interactivity, gains server-side capabilities through Node.js.

## Advantages of Node.js:

- Node.js allows JavaScript developers to run the same language on both the front end and back end.
- Code sharing becomes seamless, and the vast JavaScript community offers support and numerous third-party tools.
